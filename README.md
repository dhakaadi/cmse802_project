## Unlocking the Secrets of High-Quality Wine Using Machine Learning ##

In this project, I will work with Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to create several classification models designed to predict if a particular red wine is considered “good quality.” Each wine is given a quality score between 0 and 10. For this analysis, I converted the scores into a binary classification: wines with a score of 7 or higher are categorized as “good quality,” while those with scores below 7 are classified as not good quality.

The quality of the wine is assessed based on 11 input variables:

* Fixed acidity
* Volatile acidity
* Citric acid
* Residual sugar
* Chlorides
* Free sulfur dioxide
* Total sulfur dioxide
* Density
* pH
* Sulfates
* Alcohol

Objectives
The aims of this project include:

* Experimenting with various classification techniques to identify which one achieves the highest accuracy.
* Determining which features are most predictive of good quality wine.

Steps Involved in the Project:
1. Importing Libraries
2. Loading the Data
3. Understanding the Data
4. Addressing Missing Values
5. Exploring Variables (Data Analysis)
6. Selecting Features
7. Analyzing the Proportion of Good vs. Bad Wines
8. Preparing Data for Modeling
9. Applying Different Models
10. Selecting the Best Model
