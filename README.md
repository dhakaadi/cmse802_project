Unlocking the Secrets of High-Quality Wine Using Machine Learning

For this project, I utilized Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to develop various classification models aimed at predicting whether a specific red wine is classified as “good quality.” Each wine in the dataset is assigned a quality score ranging from 0 to 10. For this analysis, I transformed the output into a binary classification: wines scoring 7 or above are labeled as “good quality,” while those below 7 are not.

The quality of the wine is assessed based on 11 input variables:

* Fixed acidity
* Volatile acidity
* Citric acid
* Residual sugar
* Chlorides
* Free sulfur dioxide
* Total sulfur dioxide
* Density
* pH
* Sulfates
* Alcohol

Objectives
The aims of this project include:

* Experimenting with various classification techniques to identify which one achieves the highest accuracy.
* Determining which features are most predictive of good quality wine.

Steps Involved in the Project:
1. Importing Libraries
2. Loading the Data
3. Understanding the Data
4. Addressing Missing Values
5. Exploring Variables (Data Analysis)
6. Selecting Features
7. Analyzing the Proportion of Good vs. Bad Wines
8. Preparing Data for Modeling
9. Applying Different Models
10. Selecting the Best Model
